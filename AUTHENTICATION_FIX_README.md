# Google OAuth Authentication Fix

## Problem Solved

The issue was that the frontend application was not capturing the authentication token after successful Google OAuth login. The backend was successfully processing the OAuth flow and generating tokens, but the frontend had no mechanism to retrieve and use these tokens.

Additionally, there was a SQLAlchemy session management issue in the backend that caused errors when trying to access User object attributes after the database session was closed.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Authentication Dialog (`frontend/auth_dialog.py`)
- Added a token input field to the `SimpleAuthDialog`
- Added step-by-step instructions for users
- Added a "Verify & Login" button that properly captures the token
- Improved UI with better styling and user guidance

### 2. Updated Backend OAuth Callback (`backend/main.py`)
- Enhanced the success page to prominently display the authentication token
- Added a "Copy Token" button for easy token copying
- Extended the countdown timer to 30 seconds to give users more time
- Improved the visual design of the success page

### 3. Fixed Authentication State Management (`frontend/main_window.py`)
- Updated `show_login_dialog()` to properly handle successful authentication
- Added proper authentication state updates
- Added user information display after successful login
- Fixed logout functionality to properly clear authentication state

### 4. Fixed SQLAlchemy Session Management (`backend/auth.py`)
- Fixed the `get_or_create_user()` method to return user data as a dictionary instead of a User object
- This prevents SQLAlchemy errors when accessing user attributes after the database session is closed
- Updated all related endpoints to handle the new user data format

## How to Use the Fixed Authentication

### Step 1: Start the Application
1. Start the backend server: `python backend/main.py`
2. Start the frontend application: `python frontend/main.py`

### Step 2: Login Process
1. Click on "Account" ‚Üí "Login" in the application menu
2. Click "üåê Open Browser for Authentication" button
3. Complete the Google OAuth process in your browser
4. After successful authentication, you'll see a success page with your token
5. Click the "Copy Token" button or manually copy the token
6. Return to the application and paste the token in the "Authentication Token" field
7. Click "‚úÖ Verify & Login" to complete the process

### Step 3: Verification
- You should see a success message with your user information
- The menu should update to show "Logout" instead of "Login"
- Your authentication state should be properly maintained

## Technical Details

### Token Flow
1. Frontend opens browser with OAuth URL
2. User completes Google authentication
3. Backend processes OAuth callback and generates JWT token
4. Backend returns HTML page with embedded JWT token
5. User copies JWT token from browser
6. Frontend validates JWT token with backend using `/auth/validate-jwt` endpoint
7. Frontend updates authentication state and UI

### Files Modified
- `frontend/auth_dialog.py` - Enhanced authentication dialog
- `backend/main.py` - Improved OAuth callback response and added JWT validation endpoint
- `frontend/main_window.py` - Fixed authentication state management
- `frontend/api_client.py` - Added JWT token validation method
- `backend/auth.py` - Fixed SQLAlchemy session management issue

## Testing

To test the authentication flow:

1. **Backend Test**: Ensure the backend is running and accessible at `http://localhost:8000`
2. **OAuth Test**: Try the complete login flow as described above
3. **State Test**: Verify that the authentication state persists and UI updates correctly
4. **Logout Test**: Test the logout functionality to ensure proper state clearing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Token not working**: Make sure you're copying the entire token from the browser
2. **Backend not responding**: Check that the backend server is running on port 8000
3. **OAuth errors**: Verify your Google OAuth credentials are properly configured

### Debug Steps
1. Check backend logs for OAuth processing
2. Check frontend logs for authentication attempts
3. Verify token format and length
4. Test backend health endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/health`

## Security Notes

- Tokens are JWT-based and expire after 24 hours
- Tokens are stored securely in the application session
- No tokens are persisted to disk
- All communication uses HTTPS for OAuth and HTTP for local development

## Future Improvements

- Implement automatic token capture using QWebEngineView
- Add token refresh mechanism
- Implement secure token storage
- Add biometric authentication options
