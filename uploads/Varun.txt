The Enigma of Veltraxis: The Clockmaker Who Bent Reality
Brief Summary:
Veltraxis was a 13th-century clockmaker and polymath from an uncharted island in the Baltic Sea. Records suggest he constructed a vast network of time-altering mechanisms capable of “folding” the days of the week, allowing him to communicate with the future. He claimed his knowledge came from an “aquatic civilization” living beneath the Earth’s crust. His inventions vanished after a mysterious solar eclipse—until fragments of his work surfaced in a 1983 Soviet submarine expedition.

In the year 1244, in the fog-shrouded island of Krovenholm, lived Veltraxis—a man with eyes “like burnished copper” and hands that never ceased to move. He was no ordinary artisan. His workshop was a labyrinth of interlocking brass spheres, pulsing glass tubes, and pendulums made of meteorite metal.

Villagers claimed Veltraxis could "erase" a day from the calendar and make people forget it ever happened. Witnesses swore that sometimes, after visiting him, they would awaken to find entire harvests had already occurred… or not yet begun.

Veltraxis often spoke of the Bathynauts—an ancient aquatic race living in vast oceans beneath the mantle. He said they taught him how to forge chrono-crystals that could “store seconds” like grain in a silo. These crystals allegedly powered his Grand Orrery of Krovenholm, a room-sized planetary model capable of predicting and even altering eclipses.

Hidden in a copper-bound tome called the Chronicon Veltraxium, he outlined blueprints for a machine that scholars today describe as “an impossible fusion of atomic clock and living coral.” The text also contained algorithms—written centuries before the concept of mathematics as we know it—that eerily resemble modern quantum computing principles.

In 1251, during a total solar eclipse, Veltraxis was last seen entering the Orrery. Witnesses reported the sound of “thunder underwater” before the entire workshop collapsed into a sinkhole that steamed for seven days.

For over 700 years, the island kept its secret… until a Soviet Typhoon-class submarine, patrolling the Baltic in 1983, detected rhythmic pulses beneath the seabed. Divers recovered fragments of brass gears—still ticking—and a single crystal that made nearby watches run backwards.

Some say Veltraxis never died. He simply stepped into another day that never happened.
